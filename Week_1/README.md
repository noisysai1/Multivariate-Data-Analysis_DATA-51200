# Week 1: Introduction to Multivariate Data Analysis & HBAT Dataset

## Key Concepts
- Introduction to multivariate datasets and their structures.
- Overview of how multiple variables (X1–X23) interact for analysis.
- Focus on **observational units (Obs id)** and multiple independent variables.

## Dataset: HBAT (Work Import)
- Contains **100 observations** with variables `X1 – X23`.
- Each observation includes a mix of categorical and continuous values.
- Variables cover customer perceptions, behaviors, and product attributes.

###(first few observations)
Obs id | X1 | X2 | X3 | … | X23
-------|----|----|----|---|----
1      | 2  | 0  | 1  | … | 1
2      | 3  | 1  | 0  | … | 0
3      | 3  | 0  | 1  | … | 1

### Why this dataset?
- Used throughout assignments to demonstrate:
  - Regression  
  - Discriminant analysis  
  - Factor analysis  
  - Logistic regression  
  - MANOVA & MANCOVA  
  - Cluster analysis  

## Learnings
- Understood the structure of a multivariate dataset.
- Prepared the dataset for analysis (handling categorical vs numerical variables).
- Learned that **preprocessing (e.g., missing data handling)** is the first step before any modeling.
